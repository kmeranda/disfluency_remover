Instructions to run:
disfluency_remover.py trains a bigram model on data/train.txt and tests the model on data/test.txt and outputs to output.log by default. use the "-h" or "--help" flag to see what other options are available.

Note: the trigram model takes a long time to run, so it prints out percent complete as it runs
